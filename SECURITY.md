> **Note**: This security policy demonstrates comprehensive security practices for healthcare AI systems. It serves as an example of security-first thinking and responsible disclosure processes.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Commitment

We take security seriously, especially for healthcare AI systems that handle sensitive patient information. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and commitment to maintaining the highest security standards.

## üîí Security Framework

### Healthcare Security Standards

Our security framework aligns with industry best practices and healthcare-specific requirements:
