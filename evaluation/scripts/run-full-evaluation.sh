## Generated: $(date)

### Executive Summary
- Containment Rate: 87.3% (Target: >85%)
- Handoff Quality: 96.1% (Target: >95%)
- Response Latency P95: 645ms (Target: <700ms)
- Cost per Interaction: $1.74 (Target: <$2.00)
- PHI Compliance: 100% (Zero incidents)

### Key Findings
1. System performance exceeds all primary SLO targets
2. GPT-4o mini provides optimal cost/quality balance for routine interactions
3. Claude 3 Sonnet shows superior performance on complex scheduling scenarios
4. PHI redaction pipeline operating at 100% effectiveness
5. Opportunity for 12% cost reduction through response caching

### Recommendations
1. Model Optimization: Increase Claude 3 Sonnet usage for complex cases (+3% containment rate)
2. Response Caching: Implement for common queries (12% cost reduction)
3. Latency Optimization: Fine-tune prompt templates for 8% latency improvement
4. Monitoring Enhancement: Add conversation pattern analysis for proactive optimization

### Technical Details
[Detailed metrics and analysis would be included in actual implementation]

---
This is a demonstration report showcasing evaluation methodology.
Actual implementation would include comprehensive metrics, visualizations, and analysis.
