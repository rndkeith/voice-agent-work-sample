## üß™ Evaluation Methodology

### Automated Dialog Testing

**Test Scenario Framework**
```bash
# Run comprehensive evaluation suite
./evaluation/scripts/run-full-evaluation.sh

# Test specific scenarios
./evaluation/scripts/test-appointment-booking.sh --scenario routine_checkup
./evaluation/scripts/test-appointment-booking.sh --scenario urgent_care
./evaluation/scripts/test-appointment-booking.sh --scenario specialist_referral

# Regression testing for model changes
./evaluation/scripts/regression-test.sh --baseline v1.2.0 --candidate v1.3.0
```

**Scenario Categories**
- **Happy Path**: Standard appointment booking flows
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual requests and complex scheduling needs
- **Error Handling**: System failures and recovery scenarios
- **Compliance**: PHI protection and consent management
- **Performance**: Latency and throughput testing under load

### Multi-Model Comparison

**A/B Testing Framework**
```bash
# Compare model performance

  --model-a gpt-4o-mini \
  --model-b claude-3-sonnet \
  --test-scenarios appointment_booking \
  --sample-size 1000 \
  --metrics containment,quality,latency,cost

# Statistical significance testing
./evaluation/scripts/statistical-analysis.sh \
  --test-results results/model_comparison_20250818.json \
  --confidence-level 0.95 \
  --report-format html
```

**Performance Dimensions**
- **Accuracy**: Intent classification and slot extraction precision
- **Efficiency**: Conversation completion in minimal turns
- **Robustness**: Handling of ambiguous or unclear inputs
- **Consistency**: Repeatable performance across similar scenarios

### PHI Compliance Validation

**Automated Compliance Testing**
```bash
# PHI leak detection across all system boundaries
./evaluation/scripts/phi-compliance-test.sh \
  --check-logs \
  --check-metrics \

  --validate-redaction

# HIPAA workflow compliance
./evaluation/scripts/hipaa-workflow-test.sh \
  --test-consent-flow \
  --validate-disclosures \
  --check-audit-trails
```

**Compliance Test Categories**
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary PHI collection
- **Redaction Effectiveness**: Complete PHI removal from logs
- **Consent Management**: Proper consent collection and tracking
- **Audit Trail**: Complete conversation audit capabilities
