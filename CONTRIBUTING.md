## üè• Healthcare-Specific Guidelines

### PHI and Privacy Protection

**Critical Requirements:**
- ‚ùå **Never include real patient data** in contributions
- ‚ùå **No actual PHI** in test data, examples, or documentation
- ‚úÖ **Use synthetic, de-identified data** for examples
- ‚úÖ **Follow data minimization principles**
- ‚úÖ **Consider privacy implications** of all changes

### Security Considerations

**Security-First Mindset:**
- All contributions must maintain or improve security posture
- Consider potential attack vectors and abuse scenarios
- Follow secure coding practices and OWASP guidelines
- Document security implications of changes
- Never expose sensitive configuration or credentials

### Compliance Awareness

**Regulatory Considerations:**
- Understand HIPAA implications of proposed changes
- Consider impact on audit trails and logging
- Ensure changes support compliance requirements
- Document regulatory considerations

## üìä Code Quality Standards

### Coding Conventions

**C# Style Guidelines:**
```csharp
// Use descriptive names and clear intent
public class ConversationManager : IConversationManager
{
    private readonly ILogger<ConversationManager> _logger;
    
    // Clear, documented public interfaces
    /// <summary>
    /// Processes patient conversation turn with PHI protection
    /// </summary>
    public async Task<ConversationResponse> ProcessTurnAsync(
        ConversationRequest request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // Implementation here...
    }
}
```

**Documentation Standards:**
- XML documentation for all public APIs
- Clear inline comments for complex logic
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant changes
- Healthcare context explanation where relevant

### Testing Requirements

**Test Coverage Expectations:**
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for external service interactions
- Security tests for PHI handling and access control
- Performance tests for latency-critical operations
- Compliance tests for regulatory requirements

**Test Quality Standards:**
```csharp
[Test]
public async Task ProcessTurn_WithPhiInInput_RedactsPhiFromLogs()
{
    // Arrange
    var request = new ConversationRequest 
    { 
        Input = "My SSN is 123-45-6789" 
    };
    
    // Act
    await _conversationManager.ProcessTurnAsync(request);
    
    // Assert
    _logCapture.Logs.Should().NotContain(log => 
        log.Contains("123-45-6789"));
}
```

### Performance Standards

**Latency Requirements:**
- Total conversation turn: < 700ms P95
- LLM response processing: < 500ms P95
- Database operations: < 100ms P95
- API response times: < 200ms P95

**Resource Utilization:**
