- **Security Tests**: PHI protection and vulnerability scanning
- **Compliance Tests**: HIPAA workflow validation

## 🔧 Configuration Management

### Environment-Specific Configuration
```
config/
├── appsettings.json               # Base application configuration
├── appsettings.Development.json   # Development environment overrides
├── appsettings.Staging.json       # Staging environment configuration
├── appsettings.Production.json    # Production environment settings
└── feature-flags.json             # Feature toggle configuration
```

### Configuration Hierarchy
1. **Base Configuration**: Common settings across all environments
2. **Environment Overrides**: Environment-specific customizations
3. **Secret Management**: Secure credential storage and rotation
4. **Feature Flags**: Runtime behavior toggles and A/B testing

## 📊 Observability Stack

### Monitoring and Metrics
```
observability/
├── dashboards/                    # Grafana dashboard definitions
