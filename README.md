### Key Design Principles

**üîß Reliability First**
- Circuit breakers with exponential backoff for LLM calls
- Graceful degradation when providers are unavailable
- Blue-green deployments with canary traffic routing
- Comprehensive health checks and SLO monitoring

**üîç Production Observability**
- End-to-end trace propagation across all services
- Structured logging with PHI redaction at source
- Real-time metrics for latency, containment rate, handoff quality
- Custom dashboards for business and technical metrics

**üõ°Ô∏è Healthcare Security**
- Minimum-necessary PHI capture with configurable retention
- Input/output redaction pipeline for logs and metrics
- Signed request validation and rate limiting
- HIPAA-compliant audit trails

**üß™ Evaluation-Driven Development**
- Automated dialog replay testing for regression detection
- Multi-dimensional metrics (containment, quality, latency, cost)
- A/B testing framework for prompt and model optimization
- PHI leak detection and prevention validation

## üé¨ System in Action

### API Overview
The system exposes a comprehensive REST API for voice processing, LLM routing, and monitoring:

![API Overview](docs/images/swagger-overview.png)

### LLM Router & Monitoring  
![LLM Router API](docs/images/swagger-llm-router.png)
![Monitoring Dashboard](docs/images/swagger-monitoring.png)

### Evaluation Framework in Action
![Evaluation Harness in Action](docs/videos/evaluation-harness.gif)

*The system is fully functional locally with minimal setup - see Getting Started section below.*

## üé§ Core User Journey

1. **Answer & Consent**: HIPAA-compliant greeting with recording disclosure
2. **Intent Classification**: Route to book/confirm/cancel/transfer workflows  
3. **Slot Filling**: Structured data collection with validation
   - Patient name or callback number
   - Date of birth (configurable for verification vs callback)
   - Provider/specialty preference
   - Insurance information (normalized downstream)
4. **Guardrails**: Profanity filtering, turn limits, safe fallbacks
5. **Handoff**: Structured payload delivery to scheduling system
6. **Post-Call**: Redacted transcript storage for evaluation

## ü§ñ LLM Router Architecture

Provider-agnostic routing system optimizing for cost, latency, and quality:

**Smart Model Selection**
- Default: GPT-4o mini for fast, cost-effective interactions
- Promotion: GPT-4o or Claude for complex/ambiguous conversations  
- Fallback: Multiple providers for redundancy (Azure, AWS, GCP)

**Routing Logic**
```
Model Selection Pipeline:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Confidence Assessment ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Low confidence? Promote to premium model
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Complexity Analysis ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ High complexity? Route to specialized model  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Latency Budget ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Budget exceeded? Use fastest available
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Stickiness ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Stay on same model for conversation
```

**Performance Optimization**
- Per-model metrics tracking (latency, quality, cost)
- Dynamic threshold adjustment based on historical performance
- Request/response caching for common interaction patterns
- Token usage optimization and cost monitoring

## üìä Evaluation Framework

Comprehensive testing harness for measuring system performance:

### Key Metrics
- **Containment Rate**: % calls resolved without human transfer (target: >85%)
- **Handoff Quality**: % successful scheduler integrations (target: >95%)  
- **Turn Efficiency**: Average turns to successful completion
- **Latency Breakdown**: P50/P95/P99 for each system hop
- **Cost per Interaction**: Token usage and provider costs
- **PHI Compliance**: Zero tolerance for data leaks

### Testing Methodology
```bash
# Automated dialog replay testing
./eval/scripts/run-call-sims.sh

# Generates comprehensive reports:
# - Per-scenario success rates  
# - Latency heat maps
# - Cost trend analysis
# - Regression detection
# - PHI leak validation
```
